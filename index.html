      <h1>Maplestory</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">A very time intensive game, but also the only MMORPG in this list.</h5>

      <p>Personally, I would not recommend anyone to play this game unless they have good self-control and are immune to FOMO. Constant events and time consuming dailies post level 200 bundled with the fact that you can create multiple characters (and are incentivised to do so) makes it a huge time sink.</p>
      <span id="dots"></span>
      <span id="more">
      <p>If you do join, I recommend waiting for burning event where you gain an extra 2 levels when you level up (1+2).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mega-burners (up to lvl 150):
        <p>
          Can get from daily sign in reward and good for unlocking level 2 link skills
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Tera-burners (up to lvl 200):
          <p> Good for unlocking SS legion blocks or level 3 link skills if you have growth pots for lvl 200+</p>
        </li>
        <li>*Hyper-burners (up to lvl 250/260):
          <p>Good for making a new main or boss mule</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>*Can only be used at character creation or lvl 200+</p>

      <p>My personal training route to 100 cuz I hate grinding is usually:</p>

      <p>I used to be pretty competitive but being just a light spender could not make up for my skill issue as more complex game mechanics have been introduced into the game over the years along with longer boss fights which gives more room to screw up instead of constant short battles I could restart till I lucked out with a perfect run.</p>
      <span id="dots1"></span>
      <span id="more1" hidden>
      <p>The story is great but it's pretty complex with bits and pieces thrown across different media such as manga and visual novels.</p>
      <p>If you want to keep up-to-date with latest honkai news and guides, you probably would want to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarisaHonkai">Marisa Honkai</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Wyverein/videos">Wyverein</a>.</p>

      <p>Very pretty and fun. Just don't get caught up in perfect relics and speed-tuning unless you hate yourself. Or unless you like that I guess. Dailies can be done pretty fast and if you have a properly geared team, you can just turn on auto-battle and do something else while waiting.</p>
      <p>For guides I usually go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@guobacertified/featured">Guoba Certified</a> for character builds and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OkCodeTV/videos">OkCode</a> for some stuff.</p>

      <p>I don't know why I still play this game, I'm so lazy to explore the new regions and just do my daily commissions and make sure my resin doesn't cap. My enhancement crystals and artefacts keep going over the limit and I need to upgrade random weapons and artefacts to use them up.</p>
      <p>Apparently the story is pretty good now though, so I guess if you like open world exploration and a pretty good story you can try this game.</p>

      <p>One of the few games I actually don't mind playing on mobile. You can brute force most content with just 1 team. There's only 1 game mode that needs 3 teams and honestly you just need 3 solid dps characters and just pair them with some chain ultimate characters.</p>
      <p>Not sure which spreadsheet is better but I often refer to one of these 2</p>

      <h1>Snowbreak: Containment Zone</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">First shooter gacha game I've ever come across.</h5>
      <p>I spent most of my currency on the weapon banner. You really only need 2 well-built dps to clear everything. 4* Yao and 4* Sirius are great for helping you to survive if you have skill issue like me.</p>
      <p>Not sure how reliable this is, but this is the only guide I found that is somewhat up-to-date (except the latest character). <a href="https://coda.io/@flux-kairos/snowbreak-containment-zone-beginners-guide">Guide By Flux Kairos.</a></p>
      <p>For news and codes, I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/vicyush">Vicyush</a> on Twitter while I watch character and sometimes event guides by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nonpon">Nonpon</a> on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Update: You kind of need the newest characters for specific very annoying bosses and a lot of creators (inclduing those I mentioned above) stopped making content for it so honestly, I'm a little lost and just winging it now. It has dived headfirst into fanservice above all.</p>

      <p>To be honest I just play the events and sweep stages daily. It's just a cute game I play on the side. I've heard that the story is actually really good though.</p>
      <p>If you want a guideline for who to pull and what each character is good at, refer to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BO-Uh_CsAOIetPjrNyFy9-7r1a4RAtVwK135bBC3hzM/edit#gid=1085051345">spreadsheet by Midokuni.</a> There are many tabs so take you time to look through them...

      <h1>Reverse 1999</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Playing for the story.</h5>

      <p>I really love the aesthetic of this game. The tutorials that teach you the mechanics can be hella difficult since one mess up means you fail but... you'll get it eventually (probably).</p>
      <p>Since it's a new game, you shouldn't be too overwhelmed with a lot of content so it's best to start now!

      <h1>Wuthering Waves</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Open-world game like Genshin but I prefer this vibe.</h5>

      <p>To be honest, the camera is still a little wonky for me when I play but other than that, combat pretty good. The events so far haven't been too time consuming (minus the latest one). Also has pretty sick cutscenes and beautiful to play.</p>
      <p>Collecting echoes and upgrading Data Bank level is a huge pain in the ass though, also haven't bothered with collecting caskets yet although rover resonance is locked behind it.</p>

      <p>Gameplay is fun, dailies are the fastest to complete among all gacha games.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, perhaps due to gacha game overload, haven't been able to properly devote time to any of the events so far. Some quest types are rather tedious and time consuming in my opinion but some people find them fun. I will likely drop it soon.
